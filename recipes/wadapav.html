            <li>Add chopped coriander leaves and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix everything well and then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and set aside</li>

            <li>In another bowl, make a smooth and thick yet flowing batter from the besan, turmeric powder, asafoetida, a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and water.</li>
            <li>The batter should not be very thick or thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram flour. If the batter becomes thin, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons water. Set aside.</li>
