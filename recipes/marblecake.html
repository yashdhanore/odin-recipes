    <h1>Marble Cake</h1>
    <img src="/home/yash/the_odin_project/odin-recipes/odin-recipes/photos/marblecake.jpg" alt="">
    <div>Marble cake is a classic childhood cooking memory. Whether using lurid colours for a psychedelic finish, or just chocolate and vanilla, it's a teatime treat. With swirls of tender 
      vanilla and fudgy chocolate cake, this marble looks fancy but tastes like pure old-fashioned goodness, and it appeals to kids and grown-ups alike. Surprisingly, you don’t need two 
      completely different batters to make marble cake. You simply take a third of the vanilla batter and mix it with melted chocolate and cocoa powder and voilà — that’s your chocolate batter!
      Be careful not to over-marble the batters or the flavors will get muddled; a few swirls around the pan with a knife will do the trick.</div>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cake flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Hersheys</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray or lightly butter two 9-inch cake pans. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter on high speed in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the granulated and brown sugars and beat on high speed for 3-4 minutes until creamed.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs then the egg yolks one at a time, then add the vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined.</li>
        <li>Remove 1 cup of yellow batter and pour into a medium bowl. Melt 4 ounces of chocolate in the microwave, stopping and stirring every 20 seconds until completely smooth</li>
        <li>Pour an even layer of the yellow batter into each cake pan. Spoon chocolate batter on top, as shown in the photo above. Pour remaining yellow batter on top of the chocolate. </li>
        <li>Bake the layers for 22-27 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one cake comes out clean. Mine usually take 24 minutes. During bake time, loosely cover the cakes with aluminum foil if you find the tops are browning too quickly. </li>
      </ol>
